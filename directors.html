                            <p class="biography">
                                With his near-perfect record in filmography, Christopher Nolan is widely considered one of the greatest 
                                directors working today. Responsible for films including Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk, and the Dark 
                                Knight Batman trilogy, he is known for his extreme quality, and complexity. He is notorious for his 
                                particularity, often taking over as director, writer, and head of photography to ensure that his films 
                                are of the utmost quality, meeting his vision. Nolan is also fond of the Pandora's Box film style. This 
                                style features the writers including many complex and weaving plot points, leaving many questions unanswered 
                                until the very end, having everything come together. This leaves the audience in awe at the end, as they 
                                finally get to put all the pieces together.

                            <p class="biography">
                                While not being as active as director rather than writer, George Lucas is best known for his creation of the worldwide 
                                phenomenon, Star Wars. Starting as just a small idea in his notebook, Lucas funded Star Wars: A New Hope with 
                                his own money, after he was declined by major movie studios. From going way over budget, to creating a new special 
                                effects company, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), specifically for the film, Lucas was clearly dedicated to 
                                the concept. This was shown through the final product, becoming one of the biggest film franchises in cinema 
                                history, with Lucas at the helm as director for the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth installments, and serving 
                                as writer for all six. He is credited as one of the most, if not the most, influential personality in the field 
                                of science fiction filmography.

                                Famous for innovating films in the science fiction genre, James Cameron is best known for some of the best science 
                                fiction franchises of all time. From Terminator and Aliens, all the way up to Avatar, he consistently pumps out 
                                content that is of extreme quality, as well as making strides in technology through film. Cameron held the top 
                                grossing film of all time spot with Titanic, until he was beat by... himself, with his hit film Avatar. Avatar was 
                                far ahead of it's time, addressing climate change and environmental issues, while using CGI motion capture technology 
                                that had never been seen before to generate not only the world of Pandora, but the living beings that reside in it. 
                                Currently working on multiple sequels to Avatar, Cameron is slated to continue his era with a slur of hits based off 
                                his highest grossing movie, and the highest of all time.

                                Creative as can be, John Lasseter is best known for his work as Chief Creative Officer (COO) at the infamous 
                                animation company, Pixar. Started by Steve Jobs in 1986, the company is known for their meticulous quality, 
                                and for revolutionizing animation when they emerged into 3D with the first ever 3D animated feature-length 
                                film, Toy Story. Until Toy Story 2, the company never made sequels, to focus on created new stories, but have 
                                since changed this strategy, still reserving sequels until their is a new story to tell, rather than creating 
                                a new story in order to create a sequel. Lasseter was responsible for the Toy Story franchise, as well as 
                                serving a big part in evolving animation to such diverse levels. Pixar always appeals to all ages, features 
                                stories that are just as interesting to adults as the kids they are made for.

                            <p class="biography">
                                Active for over 50 years, Steven Spielberg is known as one of the most influential people in 
                                cinema history. Making his big break directing the summer blockbuster Jaws in 1975 launched 
                                his career, making him a household name after just 1 film. Since then, he has co-founded Amblin 
                                Entertainment, a Universal Studios company, which has been responsible for such films as E.T, 
                                Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan, all of which have had Spielberg 
                                at the helm. He changed the way people think about and interact with movies, playing a 
                                consultant role in the creation of Universal Studios lots and theme parks around the world. 
                                Without influential movies like Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, and Jaws, the film industry 
                                wouldn't have made such strides as it has to get to where we are today, and its all because 
                                of Steven Spielberg.
